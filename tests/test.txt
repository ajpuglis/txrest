A testing suite is coming, I'm working on it - here is a placeholder of some of my todos.

Test post errors
Test post
Test get
Test showTraceback is obeyed...

Test error message is shown when a deferred is returned.
Test recursive resource rendering
Test that allowedMethods is obeyed when implemented in client code
Test that not-callable error is raised properly.
Test rest() catch-all works.
test rest_GET, rest_PUT, rest_POST, rest_DELETE
test _format_post raises error with malformed body.
test _format_response raises error when json parse fails.

test unicode responses
test unicode posts

test regular resource logic works
test addChild logic works
test defining getChild() logic works

test mixins (inherited, and backwards behavior)

test xml api's
test raise exception on bad posts

test (TODO / implement) render_GET is prioritized before rest_GET, and allowed methods inherits
logic for any render_* methods being defined to preserve backwards compatability with twisteds
Resource() class.
